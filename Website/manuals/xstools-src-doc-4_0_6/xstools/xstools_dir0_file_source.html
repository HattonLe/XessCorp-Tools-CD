\mainpage XSTOOLs

Source code for the XSTOOLs utilities that are used with the XESS FPGA/CPLD Boards.

You can read an earlier, more linear version of the XSTOOLs source code documentation at
http://www.xess.com/manuals/xstools-src-doc-4_0.pdf .
However, this HTML document is the most-current documentation for the XSTOOLs source code
and supersedes the earlier document.

This code was compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.  The master workspace for all 
the utilities is in the xstools directory.  Makefiles for each utility are also provided.

!!Active Utilities
|| #Directory# || #Function#
| xstools | Directory that contains the master workspace file for all the other utilities.
| xstoolslib | Library of classes and utilities used by all the command-line utilities.  
| xstest | Command-line utility for running board diagnostics.
| xssetclk | Command-line utility for setting the board clock frequency.
| xsload | Command-line utility for uploading/downloading bitstreams/data to/from a board.
| xsport | Command-line utility for forcing bit values onto pins of the board.
