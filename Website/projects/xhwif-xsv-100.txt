Xilinx Hardware Interface for Xess Corp. XSV100 board.

AUTHOR:	Gordon Hollingworth

DESCRIPTION:

This zip contains the source and targets for the XHWIF interface for
the XSV100 board (Virtex XCV100 PQ24 chip)

What is XHWIF?  XHWIF is the Xilinx HardWare InterFace, and is a native
interface for programming Xilinx FPGAs from Java.  It is currently
shipped as standard with the JBits package. email jbits@xilinx.com
for more information about JBits...

Currently only the XSV100 chip is supported, if you'd like to support
one of the other chips the source is supplied so that you can.

Finally a bit of a disclaimer, if you use the JBits software and change
and write configurations to your chip, it is possible to damage your
devices!  So be careful.  This software is provided as is and I do not
accept any liability for the use/misuse thereof...

INSTALLATION

What you need...
	This software....
	JBits version 2.3 or later
	DLPortIO software available from Scientific Software Tools Inc
		(www.sstnet.com)
	Java 2 (i.e. JDK1.2.2 is good!)
	

Guidelines:

1)	In the base directory are the target files that you'll need to
	put into the right directories, you'll need to substitute the
	correct paths for your system.

copy xsv100.class d:\JBits\com\Xilinx\XHWIF\Boards

Right, now you'll need to set a couple of environment variables

The first is so that java can find the libraries (.dll's)

set path=d:\xsv100

Second we need to set the classpath for JBits

set classpath=d:\JBits

OK, thats about it...

To test your installation run the following

java Download -xsv100 xsvts100.bit

The bitstream provided is actually just the simple test program written by
XESS, so it should do some flashy things with the 7seg displays.

Source Code:

First thing to know is that native interfaces for java are not easy to
use because everyone has done it differently, so we have to compile
three different libraries rather than one!

Files

xsv100RNI.dll:

pport.cpp
xs4005.cpp
xs4005RNI.c
DLPORTIO.LIB

xs4005JNI.dll:

pport.cpp
xs4005.cpp
xs4005JNI.c
DLPORTIO.LIB

xs4005Stubs.dll:

pport.cpp
xs4005.cpp
xs4005Stubs.c
xs400510.c
DLPORTIO.LIB

Just compile/link these altogether and it should all work, one final
point is the include path for the compilations..

d:\jdk1.2.1\include;d:\jdk1.2.1\include\win32;d:\jdk1.2.1\include-old;d:\jdk1.2.1\include-old\win32

Compile the java files using whatever java compiler you use, and don't
forget to set the java classpath correctly to point at the JBits base
directory.

Thanks
